# Puzzled Pint Wordpress Theme

## About

This is the theme used by <http://blog.puzzledpint.com>. 

## Theory

This theme attempts to capture the look and feel of the main puzzled pint website. It matches color and font with one exception. I deviated in two places.

1. Beyond the navigation bar in the header, there isn't much navigation in the official Puzzled Pint site. The blog has extra navigation to go forward/back in posts, pages, search results, etc. This kind of blog navigation, to better stand out, is a lighter gray background.

2. While most links are blue, I made a conscious decision to make interactive (that is, comment-related) links red to better stand out and better encourage dialog.

This theme is a child theme of the built in “twentythirteen” theme, so we don't have a lot of room to deviate from the built-in behavior and navigation, but we have a ton of flexibility in skinning it with CSS.

## Installation

1. Install this folder (twentythirteen-puzzledpint) into your WordPress themes folder, giving you  wp-content/themes/twentythirteen-puzzledpint.
2. Open your WordPress administration page.
3. Go to Appearance > Themes.
4. Select this theme.
5. If the navigation menu isn't showing up, you might need to go to Appearance > Customize > Navigation and reselect the navigation menu.
